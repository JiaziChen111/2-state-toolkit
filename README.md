*A Toolkit for Solving Models with a Lower Bound on Interest Rates of Stochastic Duration*  
Gauti B. Eggertsson,^ Sergey K. Egiev, Alessandro Lin, Josef Platzer and Luca Riva

This repository contains the code base for the toolkit presented in Eggertsson et al. (2019), simple examples to show how the toolkit works as well as replication codes for the paper.

The latter will be published gradually over the coming days.
